Once again the company invites the public to transform the street into a vital, magic, magnetic fiesta of rhythm and light. We mix with the audience, blending in and surrounding them, moving them about, in short, our aim is to involve them in this show.\r\n</p><p>SU Á FEU is the result of many years of experience, an idea that our creative team has spent over a year perfecting down to the last detail: original scores for the musicians, preparations and rehearsals, wardrobe, lighting, choreography and movement, the composition of pyrotechnic displays – every aspect generated through teamwork during a long creative process.\r\n</p><p>SU Á FEU is an in-depth exploration of well-known ingredients like creativity, originality, energy and the keen desire to stay in the front ranks of international street theatre.\r\n</p><p>Deabru Beltzak was created in 1996 with a clear objective: to create and design itinerant street shows.\r\n</p><p>The company’s first show, Les Tambours de Feu, combined all the features that define Deabru Beltzak: teamwork, movement, streets used in new ways, percussion, direct contact with the public and, above all, lots of energy and enthusiasm.\r\n</p><p>The company took this first production all over the world, giving over 800 performances in festivals in France, Germany, Colombia, Venezuela, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Luxembourg, Mexico, Switzerland, Cabo Verde, Italy, Portugal, Croatia, Poland and England, marking a huge success both at home and abroad.\r\n</p><p>One result was that Deabru Beltzak became the best-known Basque company on the international scene, a reputation which it still maintains to this day, 20 years later.\r\n</p>",

Local musicians began to play brass instruments to gain employment as court musicians for the Maharajas, who were keen to establish bands of their own as a mark of status and power, with the court musicians subsequently adapting traditional folk music for Brass ensemble while maintaining the music’s original Indian rhythms.</p><p>Following Indian independence in 1947 and the end of the rule of the Maharajas, these court ensembles were disbanded, however the musicians found new employment as part of ceremonial wedding bands, accompanying the groom on a colourful and noisy procession to the bride’s house on the wedding night. Seventy years later the Brass Baja procession is viewed as an auspicious and essential element of an Indian wedding and there are thought to be well over 6000 bands performing throughout India.</p><p>Rajasthan Heritage Brass Band’s repertoire is an eclectic mix of traditional Rajasthan folk songs, vintage and modern Bollywood songs and their own unique take on cult science fiction themes and English language pop classics.</p><p>Artistic director: Farzana Neazi</p><p>Musicians: Mr. Istekar, Mr. Imran Khan, Mr. Mohammad Rahish, Mr. Yashpal, Mr. Haidar Ali, Mr. Mohammed Ramzan, Mr. Montu </p>",

Long gone is the era of artists like Bob Marley, The Clash, Stevie Wonder and Patti Smith getting airplay and bringing their messages to the masses. But that doesn’t mean that the revolution isn’t still brewing in the hearts and minds of many people around the globe.</p><p>Meet Mike Love. One of reggae music’s rising stars. Born and raised in Oahu, Hawaii to a musical family that spans generations, Mike Love brings a multitude of influences to the table, all tied together by the common goal of making the world a better place. Through the grassroots method of releasing his albums independently, on his own Love Not War Records label, and performing 250 plus shows a year, Love has built an ever growing following for his unique and inspiring music. He has toured with many artists in the circles of conscious, roots music, including Trevor Hall, Xavier Rudd, Nahko and many more. Over the past few years he performed to enthusiastic audiences at the California Roots Festival, Wakarusa, Wanderlust and the Montreal Jazz Fest, just to name a few. He has also enjoyed great success and exposure through the web on outlets like YouTube, with one of his videos just recently hitting 5 million views!</p><p>On his award winning debut album, The Change I’m Seeking, Love harkens the legends of roots reggae in both his lyrics and his sound, but never relies on any one genre to hold him down. Coming from a wealth of influences, Love fuses the simple rhythms of classic reggae with the complex changes of the classical and rock music he was first trained on to come up with a style wholly unique to him. On his follow up album, Love Will Find A Way, released September 1st, 2015, Love further refines his sound and message, with grand and striking arrangements and deep heartfelt emotions, he takes you on a journey which many describe as \"life changing\". He calls for immediate and drastic change in environmental impact on \"Step Lightly\", affirms his connection with fans on \"I Love You, and shows a vulnerable and touching insight into his personal life on \"Advaya's Song\" and \"No Regrets\". </p><p>But it’s his message, his passion, the wisdom behind his words that truly resonate with his fans. “It’s always been about the depth,” Mike Love explains, “I’ve never been into music that was shallow. I’m still learning about where I’m going and where I want to be. All the music is a learning tool for me too. I just make myself open to it and the messages come through. It’s just as teaching and healing for me as it is for anyone.”</p><p>His songs take you on a journey, one of healing and inspiration. One designed to help you on your path to knowledge, wisdom and understanding. On “Permanent Holiday” he takes you on a lyrical quest for freedom, both his and yours. He laments the ills of the world but also discusses solutions and ideas to change them. On \"Earthlings\" he sings about being vegan, about animal cruelty and about holding yourself accountable for your actions. These are songs with messages designed to affect change in a time when it is so desperately necessary.</p><p>With tours already booked in the U.S., Canada, Central America and Australia, 2016 is shaping up to be a big year of even more growth for Love and his musical family!</p><p>Mike Love has shared the stage with artists like Michael Franti, Trevor Hall, Nahko &amp; Medicine For The People, Xavier Rudd, Rebelution, John Butler Trio, Groundation, Steel Pulse, Dave Matthews and Jack Johnson. </p><p> Revolutionary, Conscious, Music.<br></p>",

The small village is called Plechti.. </p><p>It is the marriage of Sacha (a big time gamblerwho had returned from the USA) and Mona (a virgin, overprotected by cousins), who are together in the extremist atmosphere of the imaginary Balkan village of Plechti, to which la Caravane Passe invites you. If you risk replying to that invitation, watch out: one might meet a seductive barmaid which might attract your husband, a trapeze artist that might attach your head to the stars, a witch that might well make your underpants or your bra disappear, and a group of musicians orchestrating this Gypsy-Rock opera with brio.</p>",

After 3 years playing together, many different tracks, places and experiences together, DJ's Kevin Luke and Flávio Álvares decided to create the project Luke + Álvarez, bringing influences of house music and techno.

Well, it would sound something like Thunderpussy.</p><p>The quartet—Molly Sides [vocals], Whitney Petty [guitar], Leah Julius [bass], and Ruby Dunphy [drums]—do the most rock ‘n’ roll thing possible and quite literally fuck up every rock ‘n’ roll stereotype you know to be true. Instead of Page and Plant, Perry and Tyler, and Jagger and Richards, you get Molly and Whitney. Known for earth shattering pipes, heart-stopping performance art, and a propensity to literally writhe through a crowd, Molly is the consummate ideal front-person—bold, brilliant, brazen, and beautiful. At her righthand, you’ve got Whitney as the ultimate 21<sup>st</sup> century axe-slinger—cool, collected, and crazy on that fretboard. Rounding out the fray, Leah and Ruby cook up the tightest rhythm section this side of Cream (no kidding). </p><p>So, what is it that turned the Seattle-based group into a quiet phenomenon with the endorsement of <i>Rolling Stone</i> and Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready as well as a string of already legendary performances under their high-waisted belts (we’re looking at you, Sasquatch)? It’d be too easy say it’s the power of the P-----</p><p>Whitney steps in, “People talk about that magic. There’s some voodoo happening between Molly and I, which is like a cosmic connection. She has this power. Somehow, I’m under her spell when we’re performing—we all are.”</p><p>“The truth is, I feel the same way about Whitney, Leah, and Ruby,” smiles Molly. “We’re all in this together.”</p><p>That unity drives the band’s forthcoming full-length debut <i>Thunderpussy</i> [Stardog Records/Republic Records] produced by Sylvia Massy. The lead single <i>Speed Queen </i>begins with a revving engine and arena-size percussion before snapping into a muscular and majestic riff and vocal proclamation, <i>“Long live the Speed Queen.”</i></p><p>“The <i>‘Speed Queen’ </i>is this mythic and magical woman who rides a motorcycle and travels around the country,” explains Whitney. “Nobody knows too much about where she came from or where she’s going, but she changes everyone she meets because she’s that powerful. I was thinking of Molly when I wrote it.”</p><p>Among its arsenal, <i>Thunderpussy</i> also boasts a song produced by McCready “<i>Velvet Noose</i>.” Everything comes together into one cohesive and classic vision of rock music recharged, reinvigorated, and resurrected in what can only be described as a diamond in the muff: Thunderpussy.</p><p>“Being a lover of rock ‘n’ roll music for my whole life,” Whitney leaves off. “If you find it, cultivate it, treat it like a wild animal, and tame that raw energy, but not too much. That’s what this is.”</p>",

It was a hard childhood, not even knowing what type of mammal you were, but the toughest part was being relentlessly used by ´MUM´as a sex slave, having to fulfill all her sexual desires in order to get a bit of food.</p><p>Then the confusion that arose when MUM was killed having sex with her oldest aquisition ‘Bob’ the german shepherd who couldn´t take it anymore and ate her face – the poor guy was put down right in front of their face. Now, being freed from the clutch of MUM Furfriend look into the bright future of being popstars, knowing this is what they were born to do.</p><p>DAS UBERDOG has been listening to MUMs records on headphones ever since he found the power switch for the stereo – it was clear back then he would become an awesome producer. DINGO TUSH, the singer of the duo, howled the melody of `my favourite things´when MUM was watching her favourite show: ‘The sound of music‘ – they were clearly bound to become a music production team. It just had to happen eventually.</p><p>These times are long past now, but they have left a mark on their souls which they heartbreakingly sing about in songs like ‘GECK’ ‘FIST FUCK’ or ‘SHEPHERD’ which relates to the tough life, herding sheep just after MUM had passed away.</p><p>Originally based in Antwerp the duo has now made a move for berlin.</p><p>“Antwerp was just not the right place for us. As much perversion as there is in belgium, it is the people of Berlin we love for the open sexual deviance present all over Berlin We think this is the right breeding ground (haha) for our art.” says DINGO TUSH, the band´s cockslinging singer. Techno just has a different meaning here – everybody does it, spit in a corner, and you’ll hit a dj! “This is perfect for us because it shows what people really want. and we are here to give it to them.” adds DAS UBERDOG, the musical genius behind the furfriend productions.</p>",

			"desc" : "<p>Gabriel Le Mar is a music producer, releasing electronic music with a special focus on deep sounds and Dub inspired TechHouse. Deep dubby music you can easily dance to.</p><p> On his solo albums Gabriel produces tracks, which are tailored for the dub inspired clubber, combining different playful approaches of Dub with the functionality and stringency of TechHouse music. Bridges are built by energetic and minimal grooves. The dub-feeling is clearly the inspiration behind his sound. <br> <br> His latest album \"Among Trees I Want To Live\" is a perfect chilling slow jamming and early morning after clubbing companion. Great atmosphere runs throughout the album with either deep pulsating techno basslines, tribal drums and minimal grooves or either chill out tracks with underneath abstract electro grooves and nature sonic effects. With ears wide open the album is a therapeutic mysterious psychedelic spiritually enhanced with that inspirational mood.<br><br> With an open mind and always in a search for fresh musical experiences, Gabriel Le Mar likes to integrate himself in different artistic constellations with project pseudonyms such as Saafi Brothers and Aural Float into ambient, space and experimental sound scapes...<br> <br> Saafi Brothers got deeper into ambient-dub and add drum trills, that got the tunes rocking. The secret of the Saafi Brothers albums is the \"danceable speed\" in ambient tracks. Mostly starting with deep intros and then merging into dubbish beats for the floor, the one can especially experience in their live performances.<br><br> Next to his music projects Gabriel also works with Aural Float on audiovisual concepts: as a team they did the artistic supervision of SPACENIGHT, a prototype of a TV-concept, utilizing spectacular film- and documentary footage from outer space with music made on earth. A spacy sound to accompany the viewer for hours in space. SpaceNight became a success on german television and soon reached cult status among the young night watchers until today. End-of-Days sound for the next generation. <br> <br> In the following years Gabriel Le Mar received wide acclaim for his genre crossing dub to leftfield productions with Saafi Brothers, Aural Float and solo.<br> <br> Expect a deep + soulful Chillout-set at Sziget… Gabriel Le Mar spins a lot of his own electronic dubby soundscapes.<br> <br></p>",

Both artists were taken by the stubbornness expressed by the proverb. “The saying itself already hides dance in it,” says Guy Nader referring to the continuous flow of letting themselves fall and stand up again, one of the choreographic cornerstones of their style. At the same time he sees this movement as a philosophical metaphor, falling and standing up again as the basic principle of survival. In the bright white atmosphere of Fall Seven Times, Nader and Campos play with the Laws of Gravity. The techniques of contact improvisation and partnering allow the 11 dancers to give, receive and share weight, thus making gravity visible. Connecting through surfaces such as the floor, the back of a partner or their supporting hands they relate to each other thereby enabling the widest range of 3-dimensional movement possible.</p><p><b></b></p><p>The piece is the winner of German Theatre Prize DER FAUST 2017 Choreography category.</p><p><b></b></p><p>tanzmainz is the dance ensemble of Staatstheater Mainz, since 2014 under the direction of Honne Dohrmann.With 21-members, Germany’s largest contemporary dance company commissions world-premieres from innovative choreographers building a bridge between the theatre establishment and the international freelance dance scene.</p><p>Choreography: Maria Campos &amp; Guy Nader<br> Dance: Daria Hlinkina, Tijana Prendović, Marija Slavec, Milena Wiese, Zachary Chant, Mattia De Salve, Finn Lakeberg, Matti Tauru, Louis Thuriot, Thomas Van Praet, John Wannehag<br> Music: Miguel Marin</p><p>Set: Lucia Vonrhein<br> Light Design: Sebastian Ahrens</p><p>A Production by Staatstheater Mainz</p><p>Set up for Sziget Festival Budapest by Luka Curk</p>",

Something inside the body vibrates constantly like a threat: it is chaos, the inner noise of scars and thoughts. And this is true for everyone. Only dance can gradually bring these traces into the here and now. And wipe the gaze clean, find peace.

With that in mind, General Lodovik formed Ooostblok, a Balkan orientated dance band. Because, think of it, there aren’t many of that kind around. This 9 piece Balkan formation consists of big sturdy guys who have a few things in common: they’re friends (or family…), they all grew up in the eastern part of the Netherlands (Twente!), and they all have great affection for Balkan music.</p><p>When these maniacs think of Balkan music, they envision a party, a big, BIG, party. Through their youth orchestra, where they met, they first rubbed shoulders with Eastern-European dance music, and especially the efficacy of it. Whenever a Balkan song was played, the mood for a party was set, dance, dance, dance! The reaction of the crowd is what drives the band whenever they play live, such sheer joy and movement, that’s what it’s all about! It is simply not possible not to move your feet whenever the Ooostblok sound explodes. They started with covers of famous Balkan musicians, but now they’ve created their own repertoire! The songs are written by Bram (on bass guitar), Stan</p><p>(Tenor Sax) and Roland (Clarinet). This resulted in a very danceable Balkan/Gypsy style of music, focusing heavily on a big horn section and a big fat beat.</p>",

Despite his understanding of music being far from the glamour of the spotlight and fashion magazines, his popularity was due to “Nouvelle Star”, a talent show on French television. Ramon Mirabet’s French adventure had its pertinent media impact in Spain where more than one curious viewer discovered a talented and motivated musician, with a great desire for sharing his music. Ramon Mirabet decided to go back home, halfway between Sant Feliu de Llobregat and Sitges, but in his head the urge of adventure has never completely left. HappyDays (Warner Music Spain, 2013) was his first album, produced by Marc Parrot in Grabaciones Silvestres studios. In 2016 he released “Home is Where the Heart is” (Warner), his second album, produced in the same studios, and with which Ramon Mirabet gives the definitive leap to the big stage. Ramon Mirabet has a story, a story that talks about life, courage, fears, love, and people lost and found along the way… about doing everything that one is eager to do, no matter what it takes. </p>",

The most suitable candidate turns out to be none other than Lajos Serbán, known to all as Lajkó, whose life as a pilot reflects his lifelong attraction to the stars and an unexplored infinity with outer space.

According to ancient Hungarian custom, however, the oldest male member of the family - in this case, a relative named Koppány - would have been the successor.After Géza's death, Koppány started an uprising against István, but lost and was killed in battle. In order to deter the pagans from further uprising, his body was quartered and the pieces exposed upon the walls of the main castles of the country.In the year 1000 or 1001, István received a crown from the Pope.

Indeed the three musicians choose to live out of their music, turn pros and share a house. It is under the same roof that Breaky Boxes decided compose and record in their recording studio. The electric guitar makes room for the acoustic one, the drum turns into a kick, a low tom and a tambourine.\r\n</p><p>Breaky Boxes changes its direction, but not its boat, by choosing a new style of music that comes from the american and the irish folk music. It always has been a huge influence on their lifes for many years, and it allows them to spread a positive and enthusiastic message to the people who follow them.

Their first single “White Line Fever” was featured on blogs worldwide and featured in US TV series, including the award-winning “Shameless” and a tour that led the duo as far as to the Australian East Coast. They returned in February 2017 with “Nothing’s Older Than Yesterday”, which is a product of three years full of searching for the exciting, the unseen and the unheard. Living in London, Hamburg and Melbourne since the release of their critically acclaimed debut EP ‘Amerippindunkler’ the two-piece stole little bits and pieces from each city: East London’s boldness, Melbourne’s DIY-attitude and the fascinating weirdness of Tokyo. Cari Cari distilled all these features into their trademark sound – articulating it for the first time on their newest cut “Nothing’s Older Than Yesterday”.</p><p>In 2017 Cari Cari has performed at a wide range of festivals, taking their audience’s hearts by storm.

After high school, they pursued musical education beyond France. Their stubborness and motivation led them to end up studying in The Academy of Contemporary Music in Guilford, UK. In June 2013 the boys took part in the Polish edition of the TV Show 'Must be the Music’, where they reached second place, after receiving very supportive reactions from both the jury and the audience. </p><p>In May 2014 they played a series of prestigious polish TV events and festivals. In the summer of 2015 they signed a contract with Universal Music Poland and entered the studio with Bogdan Kondracki (a renown producer in Poland). On the 22nd of April 2016 they released their debut album ‚Grizzlin’’, which is entirely written by Elie and Mattia. The album was very well received and gained support from the likes of Ed Sheeran and LP - both of them recorded a cover of the single 'Oxygen'. </p><p>Currently they are working on their second album with the first single scheduled to be released in mid-September </p><p>BEMY will perform at Europe Stage Presented by ibis with a song especially written and composed for the occasion. As ambassadors of the ibis family hotels campaign – “Get to Sziget”, Mattia and Elie will travel across Europe for a week to get to Budapest, with a group of people selected in a dedicated contest. Sziget Festival will be a final destination of their journey.</p>",
